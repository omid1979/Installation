The objective of our project is to allow building a firewall using simpler and more modern compiling methods than the one proposed by OPNsense®.\\\n\\\nTo do this we have reworked the entire build process using Poudriere which is used by FreeBSD to build many packages and to build the entire FreeBSD system.\\\n\\\n**DynFi Build**\\\n\\\nThis is a collection of build scripts that allows you to build DynFi Firewall.\\\n\\\n&nbsp;   build_base.sh  \\\n    build_pacakges.sh  \\\n    build_installer.sh  \\\n    build_poudriere.sh  \\\n    build_sync.sh\\\\`\\\n\\\n**How to build DynFi Firewall**\\\n\\\nFirst, you need to get all the necessary repositories:\\\n\\\n&nbsp;   the FreeBSD repository used by DynFi Firewall: https://github.com/DynFi/FreeBSD-base  \\\n    the DynFi Firewall ports repository : https://github.com/DynFi/opnsense-core  \\\n    the Poudriere overlay needed to build DynFi Firewall: https://github.com/DynFi/dynfi-overlay\\\n\\\nWe encourage you to read the different readme provided in each section.\\\n\\\nThe file you need to modify is common.subr, and the interesting values are:\\\n\\\n&nbsp;   OVERLAY_PORTS - is a directory where the dynfi-overlay repo is located  \\\n    FBSD_TREE\\\\` - is a directory where the FreeBSD directory is located\\\n\\\nNext, you can use a build_base.sh script to build the kernel and FreeBSD world.\\\n\\\nThe next step is to build the packages. The build_packages.sh script is responsible for this. When you have a package, the kernel and the world, you can build the installation with build_installer.sh. Finally, you can push the required repository to a remote server with the build_sync.sh script.\"]],\"start1\":0,\"start2\":0,\"length1\":0,\"length2\":1797}]"
